<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p><h3> In this report, a linear regression algorithm is used to present an accurate analysis and prediction of medical insurance charges.  The purpose of this is to understand the relationships between personal attributes as well as lifestyle for example age, BMI, smoking etc, and the collected medical charges.  This analysis adheres to the structured pipelines that involves data pre-processing, EDA which is exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model building, last but not least and the evaluation. The IDE used for this analysis is VS code, and the coding language used is python in a VS code Jupiter notebook.   </h3></p>

<h1>Libraries used</h1>

<p><h3>In this coding analysis, there are libraries that were used, and these libraries are:
<ol>Pandas and NumPy, - this one is used for numerical operation and data manipulation </ol>
<ol>Matplotlib and seaborn - this library is used for the visualization of data. </ol>
<ol>	Script.stats – this uses Z-score to detect outliers </ol>
<ol>Statsmidels – this is for the calculation of multicollinearity using the variance inflation factor (VIF)</ol>
<ol>Sklearn – that is used for development and evaluation of machine learning and evaluation. </ol>  </h3></p>

<h1>Dataset overview </h1>  

<p>Insurance.csv is the dataset that was provided and used in this analysis, it has the following features:
<ol>•	Age: the age of a beneficiary </ol>
<ol>•	Sex: which is the gender of the beneficiary </ol>
<ol>•	BMI: body mass index </ol>
<ol>•	Children: this represents the number of dependents </ol>
<ol>•	Smoker: the status of smoking, “smoker or no smoker”</ol>
<ol>•	Region: the area of residential in the US</ol>
<ol>•	Chargers: the medical insurance cost (target variable)</ol>
The dataset was successfully loaded, and the rows were printed in order to inspect the structure of the data. The number of rows entirely is 1338.
