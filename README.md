<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><h3> In this report, a linear regression algorithm is used to present an accurate analysis and prediction of medical insurance charges.  The purpose of this is to understand the relationships between personal attributes as well as lifestyle for example age, BMI, smoking etc, and the collected medical charges.  This analysis adheres to the structured pipelines that involves data pre-processing, EDA which is exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model building, last but not least and the evaluation. The IDE used for this analysis is VS code, and the coding language used is python in a VS code Jupiter notebook.   </h3></p>

<h1>Libraries used</h1>
<p><h3>In this coding analysis, there are libraries that were used, and these libraries are:
<ul>Pandas and NumPy, - this one is used for numerical operation and data manipulation </ul>
<ul>Matplotlib and seaborn - this library is used for the visualization of data. </ul>
<ul>	Script.stats – this uses Z-score to detect outliers </ul>
<ul>Statsmidels – this is for the calculation of multicollinearity using the variance inflation factor (VIF)</ul>
<ul>Sklearn – that is used for development and evaluation of machine learning and evaluation. </ul>  </h3></p>
